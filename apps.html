        <h3>OpenTheme enables you to create Single Page Apps using document-oriented data, real-time data stores, 
        and large Data sources.</h3> 
        <h4>All this, while ensuring simplicity and scalability of GitHub Pages.</h4>
        <p>And, of course OpenTheme adds a good measure of Semantic UI, so your apps come with a modern user experience.</p>
