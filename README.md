## When to use posts, pages, collections?

Jekyll has several ways to create content. Each is suitable for certain use cases.

**Posts.** We will use posts for frequently created, chronological content.

**Pages.** Typical use cases are lists of posts, single page content like a landing page.

## How to design a blog in Jekyll?

### Target Features

- A typical blog has a collection of chronological posts. 
- A widget listing recent posts to display on home page. 
- A pagination component to leaf through posts in chronological order.
- A post has an image, a thumbnail, summary, title, permalink, and content.
- Each post has tags classifying related posts.

## How to design pages in Jekyll?

### Target Features

- Pages are normally static or less frequently updated.
- Can contain collection or list of posts.

### Patterns

**Clean URLs.** Achieve clean URLs by using folder by page name and index.html within folder for the page. 
See [Jekyll Pages docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/#named-folders-containing-index-html-files) on clean URLs.


## File Structure

### Folders

- **_includes** html partials reusable in layouts.
- **_layouts** html layouts reusable in pages. 
- **js** add site specific JavaScript to custom.js. Vendor libraries are added as minified where available.
- **css** add site specific CSS to custom.css. Vendor libraries are added as minified where available. Contains folders for assets referenced by custom or vendor css.
- **img** image assets.

### Files

- **Gemfile** defines gems required for creating local Jekyll building and serving "like" how GitHub Pages would.
