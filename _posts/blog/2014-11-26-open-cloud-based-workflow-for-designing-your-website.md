Design your next website with the freedom of switching from any device, to any place, to any operating system. All you need is a web browser.

I have Windows enviornment at work, Mac at my home office, and use Android phone and iPad when mobile. I author articles, ebooks, and create code.

My requirement is to seamlessly move from one device to next, from one place to next, without losing any time getting to next authoring or coding activity.

I have discovered a loosely coupled workflow tying four useful tools together, which lets me enjoy this any device/OS/place freedom.

- **Cloud9.** This is where I do my coding and writing. Cloud9 offers a cloud based Integrated Development Environment.
- **GitHub.** What ties it all together. Saving my work on GitHub means, even when I need to setup a new development or authoring environment, I always have my latest code or content handy.
- **Jekyll.** Static website content management for GitHub. I use this to enable a simple, yet powerful content workflow.
- **Trello.** Very useful when extending my activities to a community of collaborators or peers at work. Used for planning, collaborating, brain-storming, and communicating.
