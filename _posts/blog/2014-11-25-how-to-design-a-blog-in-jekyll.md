This article discusses our design journey in creating a blog using Jekyll.

### OpenTheme Blog Features

- A typical blog has a collection of chronological posts.
- A component listing recent posts to display on home page. 
- A pagination component to leaf through posts in chronological order.
- A post has an image, thumbnail, summary, title, permalink, and content.
- Each post has tags classifying related posts.
- Posts are classified under categories.
- Viewing a post shows related posts based on lexical analysis of post content.

### Content Workflow

One of our stated [design goals]({% post_url /blog/2014-11-29-design-goals-for-opentheme %}) for OpenTheme is the *One Minute Content Workflow*. 
OpenTheme enables this in several ways, with the help of Jekyll, GitHub and Semantic UI features.

**Markdown.** Firstly, you don't need to write your posts in HTML. Markdown offers HTML equivalent syntax that is much simpler to write formatted content.

**_posts/blog.** Any posts you author and save in this folder are published when the site is generated by GitHub/Jekyll.

**Starter Post.** Just duplicate the [starter post]({% post_url /blog/2014-12-1-starter-post %}) to get started with your own.

**Local Test.** Optionally, you can test your posts by running *jekyll build* and *jekyll serve* commands on your local setup.

**Publish to GitHub.** For simple blog workflow, you can publish and edit posts directly on GitHub.

### Search and Social Optimization

You are creating a blog to share with a certain target audience in mind. 
While marketing for your blog requires several activities outside the scope of a humble theme,
there are ways OpenTheme can help.

**Variables to Meta.** Many variables like *title*, site *tagline*, and *description*, need only by defined in one place. 
These variables then auto-populate the HTML Meta keywords, description, post titles, HTML title, and Facebook Open Graph, as appropriate.

**SEO Friendly URLs.** Human readable, unique urls for each post and page, minus the trailing *.html*. Organized by date for posts. Canonical url specified in head.
